# LMet - LTM Metrology software suite

A library plus a collection of Jupyter notebooks for the development of optical metrology techniques focused on scatterometry and hybrid metro.

- easy geometrical modeling with user expandable instructions set
- direct problem solving using 1D MMFE (RCWA-like) electromagnetic code
- inverse problem : classical, library method, ...
- includes Fresnel code for fast optical indices determination
- designed to be used within Jupyter notebook (examples included)


## Getting Started

Get Jupyter working on your computer. Download the tree. Play with the example notebooks.
